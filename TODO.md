# TODO

- [ ] Implement as compiled binary
- [ ] Structured major/minor/patch output
- [ ] Capture other version details
- [x] Support `--all` for getting the versions of `which -a`
- [x] Command to make PRs easy
- [x] Test suite driven by examples in text files (`<cmd>_01.txt`)
- [x] Simply call version command for program (saves users having to remember `-version`/`--version`/`-v`/etc.)
- [x] Multiple commands at once (`vrsn java ruby python`)
- [x] Support path to command (e.g. `/usr/bin/ruby`)
- [x] Separate stdout and stderr
